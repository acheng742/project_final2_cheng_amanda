- I tried to edit a commit with amend and I had a mini panick-attack. I wanted to change the wording and I'm not sure what happened or if I incorrectly used it, but all of my code disappeared. Is this normal? I desperately tried to research what was going on, but I just got even more confused and couldn't figure out what I was doing. I  back up my code in word doc (after an incident last semester), so essentially started over. That might've been unnessary, but I panicked. Any advice is GREATLY appreciated.
